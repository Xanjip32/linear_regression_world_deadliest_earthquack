# Worlds Most Deadliest Earthquakes: Linear Regression Analysis

## Introduction
This project explores the relationship between earthquake magnitude and fatalities using historical data from 1939 to 2023. The analysis employs linear regression implemented in three ways: pure Python, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. The dataset includes 84 significant earthquakes sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Deadliest Earthquakes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/lists-of-earthquakes-deadliest-and-largest)
- **Variables**:
  - Independent (X): Earthquake Magnitude
  - Dependent (Y): Number of Deaths

## Requirements
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
